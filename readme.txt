python -m venv venv
This command will create a venv folder in your working directory. Inside this directory, you’ll find several files, including a copy of the Python standard library. Later, when you install new dependencies, they’ll also live in this directory. Next, you need to activate the virtual environment by running the following command:

.\venv\Scripts\activate || venv\script\activate.bat
